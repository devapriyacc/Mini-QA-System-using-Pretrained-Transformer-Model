# 🧠 Mini-QA-System-Transformer  

### 📄 **Project Description**  
The **Mini-QA-System-Transformer** is a simple and effective Question-Answering (QA) system that uses a **pretrained Transformer model** from Hugging Face to answer questions based on a given context paragraph.  
This version focuses on the **Health** domain, specifically **Nutrition and Healthy Lifestyle**, providing a strong base for health-related question answering using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### 🎯 **Objective**
To demonstrate how **Transformer-based models (like BERT)** can understand and answer contextual questions accurately from domain-specific text.
